## hey becki!
i hope you like what ive kind of put together so far! in this post, ill just be telling you how this works, and how to add posts to the thread. 
pretty much, once i share this code project with you through your github account, all youll have to do is worry about the file that says _posts_, or something along those lines. the _ italicize stuff, so it wont be exactly that. Anyways, to add a post to the thread, just click the "add file", then create new file. 
you have to name your file like ive done in the github, just the date and then a title if you want, just make sure everything is separated by hyphens, and at the end there is a .md. to start writing your post, just put a double hashtag, like ive done, which is what youll title your letter. i would just put the date,
and then one space, and just start writing. it may get a bit difficult to keep track of where you are, so i reccomend writing it first in a word doc or something and then copy pasying it into github. 
if you do decide to just keep writing, and if you notice that theres like a bit of lag behind your words, you can just press enter into a new line, and just keep writing. i dont think theres a limit to how many words you can include, but i dont know yet.
if you want to see how your post would look on the thread, just click the little thing that says preview, and it should show you a preview of how your post would look on the thread. 
if you want, you can mess around in this file and just play around, and see how it works. to post your post onto the thread, just scroll to the bottom, and click,
commit new file, in green. there might be a few minutes of delay untill the website is updated, but after, thats all you have to do! i dont know about images
if you want to include an images, you have to upload them onto a website called imgur.com, and then just copy the link into your post. its pretty easy, theres no 
coding involved, none of that type of stuff. 
do not forget to commit the changes at the bottom!! without that, your letter will not be posted to the thread. to edit this, all you have to do is just click the little pencil on top of all the text. 
❤️
