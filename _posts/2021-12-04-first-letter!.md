## dear rebecca, 
hey becki! i hope you get the letter that tells you about this website, or else i just look pretty stupid right now. snail mail doesnt seem to be working, so ive decided to make this.
hopefully, if you like this, and we keep doing this, and if we keep doing it we'll just be able to see a bunch of little letters and well be able to scroll down and stuff and see them all. 
anyways, i have alot of stuff to tell you! mexico was really good and i had alot of fun! the hotel we stayed at was really nice, all inclusive, i ate so much. the water was so warm and the sand was so powdery.
we did scuba diving, we went to see the ruins in tulum, and we went to like a little beach town and walked around, which i would say was my favorite part of the trip.
you would have really liked it, there was a bunch of like old buildings which were very messy looking, plants going around everywhere, all that type of stuff. i think that out of all hispanic people, my favorite are dominicans, and then mexicans. i cant even tell you why, but they talk so funny to me. 
we missed our plane to go there, and something which only you can imagine is the way my dad got when he found that shit out. overall though, it was really nice, i really enjoyed it. when i came back,
i just spent the rest of the day with my parents and with my family and stuff. i really hope you got my book! ive been thinking about that all these weeks. i know you probably
didnt like it, but just tell me what you thought of it. i remember i was checking the usps tracking thing all the time i was in mexico, and i always get really paranoid thinking
that i put in the wrong address or zipcode or something. my school ends in like a few days after today! or my semester, i mean. i think i told you in one of my past letters all the classes im going to be taking next year,
but i dont know about what classes your taking, or what your doing next semester. tell me!, i love to hear about that shit. after the 7th of december, ill be in tampa for a month, and i dont think im going anywhere or travelling or anything. 
i think youll like this, maybe in you wont like the idea of this as your looking through the website for the first time, but i think youll like it once you start writing and stuff. 
write me back when you see this, i know it may seem a bit complicated or hard at first, but its not, you dont have do any of that coding stuff or none of that, its super easy. i put the link to the github right above this letter, and once you open it, i told you how to start writing letters and stuff in the letter beneath this one. if anything, just copy the title of that letter, and tell me in yours if you had any trouble with anything and ill help you in the response to yours.
im so excited to finally be able to hear back from you! tell me everything you have to say to me.

love,

kevin fernandez
